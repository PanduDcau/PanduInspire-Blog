  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">1. Attract an Audience</h5>

  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text">Blogging enables you to reach the billions of people that use the Internet. Blogging can help you promote yourself or your business. Blogging works as a method for attracting an audience because it provides something of value to them before asking for anything in return.

What would you rather click on, a page titled “How to Promote Your Blog“, or a page titled “Buy My Consulting Services”? By creating a blog that is of value, you can attract an audience and eventually convert them to customers, partners, friends, or otherwise.</p>
  </div>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>2. Establish Authority</strong> <br>
Having a blog and writing about important topics that are relevant to your audience establishes yourself as an authority in the space. It enhances your professional image. A blog is to professionals in the 2000s what a business card was in the 1990s. 
Blogs are the new business cards.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>3. Build Rapport and Engagement</strong><br>
Blogging can convert traffic into leads and leads into customers. Blogging can “warm up” your cold calls and traffic from other sources. If someone receives your cold call, 
they may be more receptive if they’ve read your blog and received value from it.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>4. Create Opportunities</strong><br>
Blogging can lead to other business/traffic generating opportunities. For example, speaking engagements or press. I’ve had people contact me to speak at conferences who found me through my blog. 
Blogging enables anyone with something interesting or valuable to say to be identified as an expert.</li>
